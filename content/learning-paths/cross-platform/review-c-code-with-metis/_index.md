title: Review C code for security vulnerabilities with Arm's Metis (AI-powered Security Code Review)

description: Install Arm Metis, review vulnerable C code, and triage findings from a prepared libpng target.

minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers who want to add AI-assisted security review to an existing code-review workflow. The examples in this learning path use C, but Metis is applicable to other languages as well.

learning_objectives:
    - Explain how Metis uses language-aware source analysis and model reasoning
    - Install Metis and connect it to a supported model provider
    - Review vulnerable C code and inspect JSON and SARIF output
    - Triage Metis findings against source code and a Magma-derived libpng diff

prerequisites:
    - A macOS computer, Linux computer, or Windows computer with WSL2
    - An API key and sufficient quota for a [Metis-supported model provider](https://github.com/arm/metis#2-set-up-llm-provider)
    - Basic familiarity with C, Git, command-line tools, and security code-review procedures
